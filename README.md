### Mohammad Raihan

Software Engineer, boring as hell, one of those odd fellows who loves the indoors more than the outdoors.

Love snooker, Cricket, Netflix and a big fan of GOT.

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at American Express on the Accounts Receivable platform and contributing towards the MARS project which will mordernise AR across Amex globally.
I started my career as a Graduate Java Developer at Barclays in the API team, where I delivered a couple of changes to the Barclaycard API's.

I finished my Bachelors in Computer Science from University of Edinburgh following which I pursued a Masters in Fintech from University of Strathclyde, owing to the massive change that Technology is bringing to Finance Sector.
